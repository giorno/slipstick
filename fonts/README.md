Fonts prefixed with Slipstick-Index are Iosevka ss11 fonts, widths Light, Light Italic and Medium.

They are modified so that the cube root character is populated with glyph representing square root with overhanging horizontal bar to cover the next letter.

# TODO
Modify the glyphs programmatically in a cloned Iosevka repo.
