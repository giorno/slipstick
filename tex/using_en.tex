  \large\textbf{Slide Rule is an analog computer, a device that you can use to perform all basic and some advanced mathematical operations. It is not as precise as pocket calculator, but does not require electrical power. It was commonly used even 50 years ago, the time when they started being replaced by pocket calculators. Slide rules were one of many instruments used by engineers and astronauts in space missions for flight parameters calculation. This guide describes how to use a paper made Slide Rule designated as Model A.}

  \begin{multicols*}{3}
  The Slide Rule consists of three components:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
      \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
      \item stock
      \item slide rule
      \item cursor
    \end{enumerate}

  On the Stock face and both sides of the Slide Rule there are logarithmic scales marked by capital letters. \textbf{Scales on the Stock:}
  \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
    \item L, P, K, A on the top; and
    \item D, S, T, ST on the bottom.
  \end{inparaenum}
  \textbf{Scales on the Slide:}
  \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
    \item B, CI, C on one side; and
    \item LL1, LL2, LL3 on another.
  \end{inparaenum}

  On the back of the Stock there are tables of mathematical and physical constants, and other useful graphics, but they are not involved in calculations. The Slide Rule contains, besides the logarithmic scales, conversion ratios between imperial and metric (SI) units.

  The Slide Rule slides inside the Stock and the Cursor slides on the top of the Stock. By sliding these parts, aligning the scales to appropriate positions and reading them, mathematical operations are performed.

  \textbf{Basic Multiplication} \textit{1.2 x 2.3} Move index 1.2 on scale B (\textit{Slide}) to position of index 1 on scale A (\textit{Stock}). Move the \textit{Cursor} to index 2.3 on scale A. The position that the \textit{Cursor} shows on scale B is the result: \textit{2.76}. Use scales C and D for multiplication of bigger numbers.

  \textbf{Wrap-around Multiplication}

  \textbf{Basic Division} 5.5 / 2
