  Giving sufficient amount of paper you can print and make any number of Slide Rules. This document is Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, which means that you can share it, either in printed form or electronically, with anyone. We encourage you to do so!

  For a set of printouts to make one Slide Rule you will need the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
      \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
      \item a laser printer (an inkjet printer can be use instead)
      \item 2 A4 sheets of 160-210 g/m (thick) paper (suitable for the type of the printer)
      \item 1 A4 sheet of tracing paper (also suitable for the type of the printer)
    \end{enumerate}

  Optionally you can also print the how-to guides for making and using the Slide Rule on whatever paper type you choose. If your print manager or driver supports scaling, set the scale to 100\%.

  \textbf{Thick Paper Printouts}
There are 4 pages that have to be printed on both sides of two sheets of thick paper. Front pages of those sheets are labelled \textbf{STOCK + CURSOR} and \textbf{SLIDE}. Use duplex printing.

  \textbf{Tracing Paper Printout}
There is 1 page that has to be printed on one side of tracing paper sheet. 

  \textbf{Follow Up}
Once printed, used the printouts as described in \textbf{How To Make The Slide Rule}.
